# Bookstore-App-JAVA
The Bookstore application was initially developed by a group of 4 students. The app was a final term project for COE528: Object Oriented Eng Analysis and Design. The GUI-based app was developed using JavaFX for frontend and Java for the backend. UML class and case diagrams were also developed during research and design phase. The app was implemented using the state design pattern and was applied to the customer class related to their status based on points, which they can earn when buying using cash or can reedem points to buy books. Information such as username, password and points are saved locally after every session.
